    module BPJSpec

BPJSpec is a 21-cm power spectrum code developed for the OVRO-LWA based on the \$m\$-mode analysis
formalism.

# m-Mode Analysis

m-mode analysis is a relatively new technique that has been developed for drift-scanning telescopes.
This technique begins by applying a Fourier transform over sidereal time to the measured
visibilities. This transformation introduces block-diagonal structure into the transfer matrix,
which describes how the interferometer responds to the sky. The additional sparsity in the transfer
matrix facilitates a matrix-algebra approach to interferometric imaging and power spectrum
estimation.
